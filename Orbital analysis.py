### Orbital Analysis

## Physical approach :

''' What's an orbit ? 
    It's the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object 
    The major part of orbits are supposed circulars, but to fit with reality let's consider them elliptics.
    There is severals types of orbits : Suborbitals trajectories and Escape trajectories 
    To define our orbits we will need some parameters as : Eccentricity, Half-major axis, tilt, longitude of the ascending node, perry argument, periapsis and the position.

    About the position : 
    Let's consider the average anomaly, which allows us to know the fraction of the orbital period that has elapsed since the last pass to the periapsis, expressed as an angle.
    We note the average anomaly 'M', we have : 'G' the gravitationnal constant, 'a' the half major axis, 'Ms' the mass of the planet, 'm' the mass of the studied object.
    M = sqrt(G(Ms+m)/aÂ³)*t
'''

def average_anomaly(Ms,m,t,a):
    M=sqrt(6.67408*10**-11*(Ms+m)/a**3)*t
    return M

''' The average eccentric is the angle between the periapsis and the actual position IN the orbit of the studied object. Let's not the average eccentric 'E'. Then we have :
The iteration : E[i+1]=(M-a*(E[i]cos(E[i]-sin(E[i]))/1-a*cos(E[i])) , by doing 4 iteration, we obtain a precise value of E for a t time'''

def average_eccentric(M,a):
    E=np.pi
    for i in range(1,5):
        E=(M-a*(E*cos(E)-sin(E)))/1-a*cos(E)
    return E
