## Warning ! To any user who downloaded the source files before 04/09/2019:
I have found a huge bug which made the game crash on start because of wrong `GetSystemMetrics()` data, do not worry, this issue has been fixed, I hope you can see this message. If you do, just download the files again. Executing the code should be the only thing to do after this.

## Python-Orbital-Mechanics V 0.0.5 alpha: 
The game mechanics do work, but there is still a lot of work to do (see project for more to-do-list info)
Hitboxes are currently being worked on, tests are being made, please be patient.

## Installation
Just download the files, and run the main.py file after having installed the panda lib using `pip install panda`
There are no other requirements for this program to work

## Contribution to the building of the project
If you find what seems to be a bug, and is not listed in the [To-do-list](https://github.com/the-fancy-corporation/The-PyOS-Project/projects/1), please be kind and report it in the issues section, we will definitely appreciate your help.
