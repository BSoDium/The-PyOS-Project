## Python-Orbital-Mechanics V 0.9.1: 
The game mechanics do work, but there is still a lot of work to do (see project for more to-do-list info)
Hitboxes are currently being worked on, tests are being made, please be patient. It is possible to import 3d models and test simulations using those, but it is very hard to master though, as I haven't created a syntax guide for users. If you still wish to do so, please contact us by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/the-fancy-corporation/The-PyOS-Project/issues/new/choose)

## Warning ! To any user who downloaded the source files before 04/09/2019:
I have found a huge bug which made the game crash on start because of wrong `GetSystemMetrics()` data, do not worry, this issue has been fixed, I hope you can see this message. If you do, just download the files again. Executing the code should be the only thing left to do after this.

## Installation
Just [download](https://github.com/the-fancy-corporation/The-PyOS-Project/releases/download/0.9/PyOS.release.0.9.zip) the files, and run the main.py file after having installed the panda lib using `pip install panda`
There are no other requirements for this program to work

## Contribution to the building of the project
If you find what seems to be a bug, and is not listed in the [To-do-list](https://github.com/the-fancy-corporation/The-PyOS-Project/projects/1), please be kind and report it in the issues section, we will definitely appreciate your help.
