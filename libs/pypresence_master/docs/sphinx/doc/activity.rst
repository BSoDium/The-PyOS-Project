   :param str large_image: name of the uploaded image for the large profile artwork

   Upon initialization, the Activity will update the rich presence. Editing any of the parameters later on will also cause the Activity to auto-update the rich presence.

   **Example:**

   .. code-block:: python

     from pypresence import Presence, Activity
     import time

     client_id = '5834659349'  # Fake ID, put your real one here
     RPC = Presence(client_id)  # Initialize the client class
     RPC.connect() # Start the handshake loop

     ac = Activity(RPC) # Make the activity

     ac.start = int(time.time()) # Setting the start time, auto updates the presence

     while True:  # The presence will stay on as long as the program is running
         time.sleep(15) # Can only update rich presence every 15 seconds


|br|

  .. py:function:: end_in(time_until_end)

     Specify how long until the countdown reaches 0 on your Rich Presence.

     :param int time_until_end: How long (in seconds) it will take before the countdown reaches 0.

|br|

 .. py:function:: started_at(seconds_ago)

   Specify how many seconds the timer on your Rich Presence should be at.

   :param int seconds_ago: How long (in seconds) that the program has been running / number of seconds to be on the timer
